# Customer Churn Analysis
 
## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or not based on a variety of features. We will use machine learning techniques to build a model that can accurately predict churn based on historical data.

## Objective

- Predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms.
- Identify the most important features contributing to churn.
- Build a predictive model with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer information, including:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Account information (contract type, payment method, etc.)
- Service usage statistics
- Churn status (target variable: whether the customer churned or not)

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading and cleaning the data
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the data distribution
   - Analyzing correlations between features and churn
   - Identifying patterns and trends in customer churn

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features if necessary
   - Selecting relevant features for model training

4. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets
   - Training various models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
   - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
   - Comparing model performance and selecting the best model

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Identifying the features that contribute the most to the model's prediction using feature importance scores
   - Visualizing the importance of features

## Results

- The best-performing model will be selected based on the evaluation metrics.
- Feature importance will be plotted to understand the impact of different features on churn prediction.
